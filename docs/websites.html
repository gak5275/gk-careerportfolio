        <p>Two college classmates and I created a website on which we share our analysis of the video game
            Stardew Valley. (my favorite game!) We looked at the text in the game's code and
            found recurring themes in the dialogue. We also looked at which characters have the most
            lines of dialogue in specific locations throughout the game.</p>

        <p>This is a research project I did on runes from the age of the Vikings. We were required to make a unique component of our projects based on our individual talents, so I made mine a website with multiple pages.</p>
